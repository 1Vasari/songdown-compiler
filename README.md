# Changes

### 0.2.1 (2015-1-14)
- Fixed indentation of code for better consistency.

### 0.2.0 (2015-1-14)
- Fixed up the code so that it's (slightly) usable.

### 0.1.0 (2015-1-14)
- Initial version as pulled from the (exceedingly cluttered) `1vasari/songdown` repository. None of this code will work until things have moved around a little more.
